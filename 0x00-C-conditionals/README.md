This requires combining multiple concepts you’ve practiced from previous projects.

You get 5 attempts to solve before I give full explanation.

Here’s how we’ll proceed:

I’ll release Project 1 (Odd or Even Checker).

You attempt it.

I’ll give hints if you fail, up to 3 times.

After you succeed, we move to Project 2.

We continue up to Project 20.
